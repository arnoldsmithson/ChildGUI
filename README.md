This program's goal is to guide a young demographic through a series of slides that test's their ability to distinguish whether two sentences are referring to one object or two. The process is as follows: 

## Data Information

The user(subject) enters their ID Name (which can be any alphanumeric combination), birthday (MM-DD-YYYY), and which order of slides to use (1-3 or 1-6)

## Intro

Three intro slides are given before the practice slides where the study is explained and the subject meets the pictures they are to click on for the duration of the exam.

## Practice 

Three practice slides are presentned that showcase the possible order of events that can occur in the exam.

### Practice 1
This practice slide shows the subject that two different objects can be clicked.

### Practice 2

This practice slide shows the subject that the same object can be clicked twice.

### Practice 3

This slide shows the subject that none of the objects have to be clicked if they realize the sentence is wrong.

## Exam

These slides continually test the subject's ability while recording their click details and reaction times during each slide. Each slide is written to a readable text file whos name matches the ID given at the start of the exam and a general .CSV file named Statistics.csv . A break is given every 15 slides where the subject can choose to continue the exam or stop the exam. If exam is stopped before a break is reached, the test restarts at the previously cleared break.
